# PsyChild. Tracking clinical psychedelics in minors.
PsyChild is a database of clinical research with psychedelics and related compounds in minors. Its main aim is to provide a growing bibliography on this multidisciplinary field for researchers, research subjects, patients, guardians, clinicians, critics, and external experts. Some of the provided records contain accounts of violence, homophobia, and unethical conduct, underscoring the urgent need to grapple with the difficult history of this field. Due to the cross-pollination of different research strands in this multidisciplinary field, PsyChild not only includes “classic” psychedelics but also related compounds such as entactogens like mCPP and αET, deliriants like atropine and scopolamine, and dissociatives like ketamine and PCP. While PsyChild takes a neutral stance on the question whether psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) should be provided to minors, we do call for evidence-based, harm-reduction-oriented PAP protocols designed for minors in case research or treatment should be carried out. Inclusion in the database does not equal endorsement. PsyChild is committed to an open science approach and welcomes suggestions and submissions.
